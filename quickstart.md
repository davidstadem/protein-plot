# Quick Start

1. Go to the website. 
2. Download the data as a CSV file. 
3. Update prices with your own findings.
4. Add your own foods with your own nutrition facts. 
5. Upload the CSV file back to the website. 
6. Click the export button to save it as your own. 

- **Download the Nutrition Facts** used in this plot as a CSV file.
- **Upload your own Nutrition Facts** by clicking the Upload button, or dragging and dropping your own file into the space. You'll need to upload a CSV file with information about the nutrition and price of each food.
    - Here are all the columns in my CSV: `Name,From,Date,Price,Number,Unit,Servings per container,Calories per serving,Fat g,Carb g,Protein g`
    - You need at a minimum the following columns: `Name,Price,Servings per container,Calories per serving,Protein g`

I'd like to make the process much easier, but I'll need some more time to get that going. Then it'll be a 3 step process. Go to the website, click around to change prices, and export your results. 

# Notes

- in the CSV, you can delete rows for foods that you don't want. 
- You can just go in and update the price in the CSV. I've already entered in the nutrition facts. 
- Certain columns (From, Date, Number, Unit) won't impact the calculation at all. They're just for information. 
- The key is Servings Per Container. You need the right number for how many servings you're getting when you spend *x* amount of money.
