# The Protein Plot

![protein plot](static/protein-plot.png#thumbnail)

# Intro
This is the Protein Plot, a tool to help you identify cheap protein. You can use cheap protein as the driver for cheap food.

The goal is to get the *highest Protein Percentage* (further to the right) for the *lowest Protein Price* (further down).
Use the plot to train your instincts and figure out which foods make the best building blocks of a frugal meal plan.

# Reproduce the Plot

Generate the plot like this:

```python
python protein_plot.py
```

Run the dash app (which wraps a flask app):

```python
python dash_app.py
```

# Development
Development is at https://github.com/davidstadem/protein-plot
